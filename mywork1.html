        <h1 align = center><b>Python Snake Game</b></h1>
        <h2> Designed and developed a Python-based Snake Game using Pygame, implementing key features such as real-time user input handling, collision detection, dynamic scoring, and smooth game flow, demonstrating proficiency in object-oriented programming and game development principles.</h2>
            <br>
           <h2> Tech Stack:
Programming Language: Python
Game Library: Pygame
Core Features:
Real-time user input handling (keyboard controls)
Collision detection for walls and self-collision
Dynamic score tracking and display
Smooth animations and game flow management
Object-oriented design for scalability and maintainability
This combination of Python and Pygame allows for the creation of interactive 2D games with efficient graphics rendering and easy integration of game logic.
